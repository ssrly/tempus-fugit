    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p class="text-center">If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.</p>
    <p class="text-right"><i>- Marcus Tullius Cicero, philosopher and statesman.</i></p>
    <p>The lack of a automated testing, framework, ORM or even OOP did challenge me quite a lot, nevertheless... its
        done!</p>
    <p>I'm happy, the planed core features could find their way into existence.</p>
    <p><a href="https://trello.com/b/zK2v7haI/board">This is my Trello Board</a>, if You are registered, i can give
        access. It shows the progress of this project pretty accurate.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ssrly/tempus-fugit">And the GitHub Repository</a>. It is public.</p>
    <h3>Core Features:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
