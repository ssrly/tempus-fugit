    <h2>Home</h2>
    <h3>Greetings!</h3>
    <p class="text-center">
        <strong>If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-right"><i>- Marcus Tullius Cicero, philosopher and statesman.</i></p>
    <p>The lack of a automated testing, framework, ORM or even OOP did challenge me quite a lot, nevertheless... its
        done!</p>
    <p>I'm happy, the planed core features could find their way into existence and so the project "Tempus Fugit" is
        usable.</p>
    <p><a href="https://trello.com/b/zK2v7haI/board" target="_blank">This is my Trello Board</a>, if You are registered, i can give
        access. It shows the progress of this project pretty accurate.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ssrly/tempus-fugit" target="_blank">And the GitHub Repository</a>. It is public.</p>
    <h3>Core Features:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Registration / Login</li>
        <li>User / Admin</li>
        <li>Users can change their own records</li>
        <li>Admins can change all records</li>
        <li>Time tracking</li>
        <li>Responsiveness</li>
        <li>Forms / Details in modal windows</li>
        <li>Form validation with initial validation of conflicting time records</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Planned - not yet implemented:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The JS file is a mess (-.-) ... it needs refactoring</li>
        <li>User management by groups</li>
        <li>Time tracking by stopwatch as option</li>
        <li>Show, who changed records and when</li>
        <li>Better Time tracking validation, for competing time records</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
